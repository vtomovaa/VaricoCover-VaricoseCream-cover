                <h1>WHAT ARE VARICOSE VEINS
                </h1>
                <p>Varicose veins are swollen and enlarged veins – usually blue or dark purple – that usually occur on
                    the legs. They look lumpy, bulging or twisted in appearance and are caused by increased blood
                    pressure in the veins. Varicose veins happen in the veins near the surface of the skin
                    (superficial). The blood moves towards the heart by one-way valves in the veins. When the valves
                    become weakened or damaged, blood can collect in the veins.
                </p>
                <p>Our <b>Varicose Veins Cream</b> will improve the look of the varicose veins or spider veins on your
                    legs.
                    It
                    will improve skin tone, minimize varicose and spider veins, and moisturize all at the same time.</p>

                                really noticed that swelling and inflammation are disappearing. Maybe not so fast, but
